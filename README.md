# Infinite Scroll

A modern web application that implements infinite scroll functionality to display images from the Unsplash API. As users scroll down the page, new images are automatically loaded, creating a seamless browsing experience.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**[View Live Demo](https://ashley-desouza.github.io/infinite-scroll/)**

Experience the infinite scroll functionality in action! Scroll down to see images automatically load as you approach the bottom of the page.

## Features

- ✨ **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically loads more images as you scroll near the bottom of the page
- 🖼️ **Unsplash Integration**: Fetches high-quality random images from the Unsplash API
- ⚡ **Loading States**: Visual loader indicator while images are being fetched
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Minimalist design with smooth user experience
- 🔗 **Image Links**: Click on any image to view it on Unsplash

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Async/await for API calls and scroll event handling
- **Unsplash API**: For fetching random images

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/ashley-desouza/infinite-scroll
	cd infinite-scroll
	```

2. Get your Unsplash API key:
   - Visit [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Create a new application
   - Copy your Access Key

3. Configure the API key:
   - Open `script.js`
   - Replace the `apiKey` constant with your Unsplash API key:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_UNSPLASH_API_KEY';
   ```

4. Open the application:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local development server (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (with http-server)
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. The initial load will fetch 5 images
3. Scroll down the page to automatically load more images (30 at a time)
4. Click on any image to view it on Unsplash in a new tab
5. The loader will appear while new images are being fetched

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: On page load, the application fetches 5 random images from Unsplash
2. **Scroll Detection**: A scroll event listener monitors when the user approaches the bottom of the page (within 1000px)
3. **Image Loading**: When the threshold is reached, the app fetches 30 more images
4. **Image Display**: Images are dynamically added to the DOM with links to their Unsplash pages
5. **Loading State**: A loader is shown while images are being fetched and hidden once all images have loaded

**Important**: This project requires an Unsplash API key. Make sure to:
- Keep your API key secure and never commit it to public repositories
- Respect Unsplash API rate limits
- Follow Unsplash API [Terms of Service](https://unsplash.com/api-terms)
